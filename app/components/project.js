                  1. What is it?
                  <br />
                  This project involved conducting penetration tests on
                  simulated IT environments to evaluate their security posture.
                  The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them to
                  demonstrate potential risks, and provide actionable
                  recommendations to mitigate these security flaws. The tests
                  included activities like network scanning, SQL injection,
                  command injection, and privilege escalation.
                  <br />

                  1. What is it?
                  <br />
                  This project involved deploying and managing Nextcloud, an
                  open-source file-sharing and collaboration platform, on AWS.
                  The solution integrated AWS services such as EC2, S3, EFS, and
                  CloudWatch for deployment, storage, monitoring, and disaster
                  recovery. The project emphasized scalability, security, and
                  reliability by implementing best practices in cloud
                  infrastructure design.
                  <br />

                  showcasing my proficiency in cloud services, security
                  auditing, and disaster recovery planning. <br />

                  3. Which Technical Skills are being demonstrated?
                  <br />
                  - Cloud Infrastructure Design: Set up a Virtual Private Cloud
                  (VPC) with secure subnets and configured security groups for
                  controlled access.
                  <br />- AWS Services Integration: Utilized EC2 for hosting, S3
                  for object storage, EFS for persistent configuration storage,
                  and CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.
                  <br />
                  - Disaster Recovery: Designed and documented backup and
                  recovery processes using AWS Backup and lifecycle policies for
                  data retention.
                  <br />- Automation: Used Docker to containerize Nextcloud and
                  configured persistent volumes for storage consistency.
                  <br />
                  -Networking: Configured Dynamic DNS and Elastic IP for
                  seamless accessibility and scalability.

                  -Security Practices: Conducted a security audit using
                  Nextcloudâ€™s security tools and AWS best practices to address
                  vulnerabilities and ensure secure access.
